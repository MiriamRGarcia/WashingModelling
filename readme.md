To run the different codes

- Download AMIGO2 toolbox in [sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox](sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox)

- Copy the AMIGO2 folder in this path

- Configure your matlab to run AMIGO2 with C++ mex files

- Run in Matlab Run_all.m to compute all the calculations in  2025 - Moreno et al - Virtual Representation of Fresh Produce Washing in 4.0 Industry: Modelling and calibration through optimal experimental design

# Notes

- AMIGO_changes folder include changes of AMIGO2 toolbox to
  
  - allow the use of error_data always (even for OED)
  
  - allow multiexperiment estimation with more than 20 experiments

- Exp_data includes experimental data of industrial washing processes

- OED_codes includes necessary codes to run the OED section

- Pre_optims includes the best solutions for each of the problems. As some optimisations take hours and many tests of computations, we start from current this optimum. 

- Results folder includes the results generated by the code
