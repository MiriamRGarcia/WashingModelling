#   "Chlorine inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in fresh produce wash process: Effectiveness and modeling." 
#   International Journal of Food Microbiology 356:109364.

# In this version, the complete model (taking into account the different produces) is considered.
# The parameters used were the previously estimated from the experimental data in 
# "Data extraction RQ1a and RQ2a_Step 2_17032023.xlsx".

# Solutions are stored in SSol as follows:
#  SSol[,1]= FC    ; [mg/L] Free Chloride 
#  SSol[,2]= COD   ; [mg/L] Chemical oxygen demand 
#  SSol[,3]= Xw    ; [CFU/mL] Concentration of bacteria in water 
#  SSol[,4]= Xil   ; [CFU/g] Concentration of bacteria in iceberg lettuce 
#  SSol[,5]= Xrl   ; [CFU/g] Concentration of bacteria in red lettuce 
#
# Also, the concentrations of Xw and Xil  were stored apart in log10 scale as
#  logxw[]= Log10(Xw)
#  logxil[]= Log10(Xil)
